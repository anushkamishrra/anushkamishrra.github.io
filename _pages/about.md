I am a PhD candidate in Energy, Environmental and Chemical Engineering.at Washington University in St. Louis. My broad research interests include lead corrosion and control and drinking water treatment. I am interested in understanding the fundamental processes that drive the release of lead to drinking water and assess the impacts of corrosion control and blending advanced treated water in water distribution network through pipe loop studies.
