Hi! I am Anushka and thank you for visiting my website.

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Sedlak Research Group](https://sedlakgroup.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://ce.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} at UC Berkeley. I earned my Ph.D. from the [Department of Energy, Environmental and Chemical Engineering](https://eece.wustl.edu/index.html){:target="_blank"} at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I conducted research at the intersection of environmental chemistry and water quality engineering at the [Aquatic Chemistry Lab (ACL)](https://sites.wustl.edu/aquaticchemistrylab/){:target="_blank"} under the guidance of [Dr. Daniel Giammar](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Daniel-Giammar.html){:target="_blank"}.  

My core research interests revolve around improving the quality of conventional and non-conventional drinking water sources. My doctoral research focused on assessing the role of water chemistry on the release of lead and other metals from lead bearing plumbing in drinking water during water supply and augmentation.
