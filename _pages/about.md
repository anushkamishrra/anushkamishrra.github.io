Hi! I am Anushka and thank you for visiting my website.

I am a final year Ph.D. candidate and AWWA Abel Wolman doctoral fellow in the [Department of Energy, Environmental and Chemical Engineering](https://eece.wustl.edu/index.html){:target="_blank"} at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I am conducting research at the intersection of environmental chemistry and water quality engineering at the [Aquatic Chemistry Lab (ACL)](https://sites.wustl.edu/aquaticchemistrylab/){:target="_blank"} under the guidance of [Dr. Daniel Giammar](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Daniel-Giammar.html){:target="_blank"}.  

My core research interests revolve around improving the quality of conventional and non-conventional drinking water sources. My doctoral research is focused on assessing the role of water quality on the release of lead and other metals from lead bearing plumbing in drinking water.
